        You can deactivate your account by entering your password below. Deactivating your account will delete your
        private account information, but it will not delete your contributions to the site.

      </p>Deactivating your account will do the following things: </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Change your username to a generic username (<i>user_<%= @user.id %></i>).</li>
        <li>Delete your password, email address, <%= link_to_wiki "API keys", "help:api" %>, and account settings.</li>
        <li>Delete your <%= link_to_wiki "saved searches", "help:saved_searches" %>.</li>
        <li>Delete your <%= link_to_wiki "private favorite groups", "help:favorite_groups" %>.</li>
        <li>Delete your private favorites and upvotes (only if <%= link_to_wiki "privacy mode", "help:privacy_mode" %> is enabled).</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The following things will <strong>not</strong> be deleted:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Posts you've uploaded.</li>
        <li>Your comments, forum posts, and private messages.</li>
        <li>Your tag edits, wiki edits, translation notes, and any other contributions you've made to the site.</li>
        <li>Your login history, including your IP address and geographic location. This is kept for moderation purposes.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>If you just want to change your username, you can <%= link_to "change your name here", change_name_user_path(@user) %>.</p>

      <p>
        Enter your password below to deactivate your account. This cannot be
        undone. Your account cannot be recovered after it is deactivated.
      </p>
