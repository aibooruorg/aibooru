      <li>
        Your other personal activities on the Site, such as your favorites,
        favorite groups, and saved searches, will normally be visible to other

        Your username will be publicly associated with any content you create
        or edit on the Site. The date and time you created or edited the
        content will also be publicly visible. Moderators may also be able to
        see the IP address associated with any content you create or edit on
        the Site.
      </li>

      <li>
        When other users view your profile, they will be able to see
        information about your activities on the Site, such as your username,
        signup date, uploads, favorites, votes, post edit history, comments,

        When you send another user a private message, the recipient of that

        and the date and time the message was sent. Recipients may choose to
        share your message publicly or with other users. Recipients may

      <li>
        <strong>With your consent</strong>.

        security measures.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Aggregated or anonymized information</strong>.
        We may share information about you that has been aggregated or anonymized
        such that it cannot reasonably be used to identify you. For example, we
        may show the total number of times a post has been visited without
        identifying who the visitors were, or how many times a tag has been
        searched without identifying who the searchers were.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>To enforce our policies and rights</strong>.
        We may share information if we believe your actions are in violation of

      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>To comply with the law</strong>.
        We may share information in response to a request for information if we
        believe disclosure is in accordance with, or required by, any applicable
        law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, including, but not
        limited to, meeting national security or law enforcement requirements. To
        the extent the law allows it, we will attempt to provide you with prior
        notice before disclosing your information in response to such a request.

      <li>
        <strong>In an emergency</strong>.
        We may share information if we believe it's necessary to prevent imminent
        and serious bodily harm to a person.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Business transfers</strong>. We may share or transfer your
        information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger,
        sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion
        of our business to another company.
      </li>
    </ul>
