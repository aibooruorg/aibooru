          <li>You should approve anything you think is good quality. A good rule of thumb is to approve things you would upload yourself.</li>
          <li>If you're unsure whether something should be approved, you can skip it and let other approvers take a look.</li>
          <li>You can reject a post as "Poor quality" or "Breaks rules" to tell other approvers that you think the post shouldn't be approved.</li>
          <li>You can give a "Detailed rejection" to explain why you think a post shouldn't be approved. This message is seen by the uploader, so don't be rude.</li>
          <li>Posts should only be manually deleted if they clearly break the <%= link_to_wiki "help:upload rules" %> or are extremely bad (so bad they shouldn't stay up the full 3 days).</li>
          <li>If you haven't approved at least 30 posts in the last 45 days, you will lose approver privileges for inactivity.</li>
