These are your backup codes for your Danbooru account. If you lose your phone or
your two-factor authentication app, you can use these codes to login to your account.

<% @user.backup_codes.to_a.each do |code| %>
<%= code.to_s.rjust(User::BACKUP_CODE_LENGTH, "0") %>
<% end %>

Keep these codes in a safe place. If you lose both your authenticator app and
your backup codes, then you will be locked out of your account permanently.

Each code is one-use only. After you use a code, be sure to cross it out and go
to your account settings and get a new code.
