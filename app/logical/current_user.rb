# A global variable containing the current user, the current request, whether
# safe mode is enabled, and whether save-data mode is enabled.
#
# The current user is set during a request by {ApplicationController#set_current_user},
# which calls {SessionLoader#load}. The current user will not be set outside of
# the request cycle, for example, during background jobs, cron jobs, or on the
# console. For this reason, code outside of controllers and views, such as
# models, shouldn't rely on or assume the current user exists.
