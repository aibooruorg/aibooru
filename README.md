## Quickstart

Run this to start a basic Danbooru instance:

```sh
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aibooruorg/aibooru/master/bin/danbooru | sh
```

This will install [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) and use it
to start Danbooru. When it's done, Danbooru will be running at http://localhost:3000.

Alternatively, if you already have Docker Compose installed, you can just do:

```sh
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aibooruorg/aibooru/master/docker-compose.yaml
docker compose up
```

You will likely need to run docker with elevated permissions.

If you get an error such as `'name' does not match any of the regexes: '^x-'` make sure
that you're running an updated version of Docker Compose.

## Installation

See the [Docker Guide](https://github.com/danbooru/danbooru/wiki/Docker-Guide) for more information on running Danbooru using Docker. This is the recommended way to run Danbooru.

Alternatively, you may use the [Manual Installation Guide](https://github.com/danbooru/danbooru/wiki/Manual-Installation-Guide) to install Danbooru without Docker. Manual installation is much more difficult than using Docker, and therefore is not recommended or officially supported.
