# This script sets up everything need to run Danbooru under Docker. It installs Docker and Git (if
# they're not already installed), downloads the Danbooru code from Github (if it's not already
# downloaded), and initializes the config files.
#
# If this script is run with `curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danbooru/danbooru/master/bin/setup | sh`,
# then it will automatically run `docker compose up` to start Danbooru. Otherwise you can run `docker compose up`
# manually to start Danbooru.

# Usage:
#
#  $ bin/setup
#  $ sudo docker compose up
