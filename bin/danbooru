# Usage:
#
#     bin/danbooru up   # start Danbooru
#     bin/danbooru down # stop and remove Danbooru container.
#     bin/danbooru help # show Docker Compose help
#
# Alternatively, if you already have Docker installed, you can just do:
#
#     docker compose up
#
# This script is just a wrapper for that command.
